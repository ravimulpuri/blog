I *will* write articles that broadly fall in the following categories
1. **Tensorflow** and **Pytorch** implementation of several networks, architecture etc. 
2. Computer vision articles based on concepts learned from _Deep Learning for computer vision with python_ series from Dr. Adrian Rosebrock and fastai courses
3. Natural Language Processing(NLP) articles based on concepts learned from NLP courses available online
4. **Book Reviews** - I set an ambitious goal to read 24 books in 2020. I completed 9 books so far. I will pen down my notes and highlights from each book
5. **Trip photos** - I travel regularly to national parks throughout US. I will post trip experiences through text and photos

And articles that may not fall in to the categories mentioned above
