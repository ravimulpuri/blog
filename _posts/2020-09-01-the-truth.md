### Review

This book discusses various aspects of Niel's life from childhood to his present life and informs us how the past, especially childhood, can still influence the present and the future.<br /><br />Laurene's idea of a healthy relationship stuck in my head as I think a lot about what it means to be independent as an individual and in a relationship. In relationships where a person depends on another person for several needs (for example, financial needs), how do the dynamics of the healthy relationship change?

> A healthy relationship is when two individuated adults decide to have a relationship, and that becomes a third entity. They nurture the relationship, and the relationship nurtures them. But they're not overly dependent or independent, but they are interdependent, which means that they take care of most of their needs and wants on their own. When they can't do something on their own, they are not afraid to ask their partner for help. When our love for someone exceeds our need for them to, we have a shot at a genuine relationship together

Oh my!! Neil goes completely crazy when he decides to leave the therapy altogether to explore poly lifestyle. But it's tough to be confident about the recovery process when there are red flags around the recovery steps and the process. Neil couldn't trust the system that failed to make any logical sense to him as his teachers had hidden motives and so failed to answer all his logical questions<br /><br />The third part of the book expands a lot on his new lifestyle often unnecessarily. The ending seems rushed with over simplification of his issues and failure to add any details about the life of Neil and Ingrid around the time they decide to get married

Overall, the book feels like a honest narrative of a narcissistic person who tried to find the meaning of love within the constraints posed by his own lifestyle and upbringing. I came to know that in 2018, the couple filed for divorce and are happily(sic) separated. So the reader should exercise some caution while making conclusions from the book about love and relationships.
