### Review
---
I didn't know much about Nike's history until I read this book by Phil Knight.<br /><br />I loved Phil's travel stories from around the world. Traveling around the world at such an early age helped Phil understand the intricacies of different cultures, enabling him to navigate supply chain constraints later. <br /><br />Phil didn't start Blue Ribbon to create the best shoe company. The whole idea of starting a company is an afterthought after receiving a contract to sell shoes in the US. Gradually, the business turned into an obsession, which led to create and sell a new line of shoes. <br /><br />It's amusing to read Phil's struggle to keep Blue Ribbon afloat, flaunt bank rules, steal an official's notes. Amusing as it's so well written without adding the heaviness of creating a billion-dollar company or being preachy with some entrepreneurship BS.
