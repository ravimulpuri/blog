My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3676699881">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I have not watched any match that Sanjay played for India, but I watched many matches in which he was a commentator. I liked his commentary, and as he came across as someone who is not afraid to call a spade as a spade. <br /><br />Coming to this book, I liked the first few chapters, where Sanjay explained how his childhood shaped his career choice as a cricketer and his batting style (defensive). Sanjay played cricket for fame and is forthcoming about it. <br /><br />It is interesting to read about Mumbai cricket scene, Ranji tournaments, and North vs West zone rivalry. Sadly, Sanjay played cricket when India is not competitive in away matches, not aggressive in their approach towards the game, and not supportive to fellow cricketers. <br /><br />Since I did not watch any of his matches, I could not connect too much of Sanjay's cricketing life. However, in the last chapter, Sanjay goes into the details about his life as a commentator. Sanjay chose to be a commentator to be visible in the public eye and not fade out like other cricketers in his generation. As a commentator, Sanjay can get extremely critical because of his analytical mindset. However, many cricketers/viewers took it personally instead of seeing it as a person doing his job. I am glad Sanjay is not backing down from being critical as some of the commentators do not trust the intelligence of the viewers. <br /><br />It is a welcoming book if you are interested in the game. Former cricketers, in their autobiographies, tend to glorify their struggle or game or write about controversies to sell but this book isn't
