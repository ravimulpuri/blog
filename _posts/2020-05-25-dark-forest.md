### Review
---

This book discusses various issues humans face when the battle gets inevitable—defeatism, triumphalism, nostalgic feelings, future civilization, etc. The issues are conveyed by intertwining them in the book narration

Tri-Solaris attempts to assassinate Luo Ji using a custom virus mapped to his DNA in the standard era, and the killer 5.2 software virus in the crisis-era shows the author's creativity to adapt the writing style.

> The birth of a new civilization is the formation of a new morality

Zhang Behai's portrayal as a triumphalist despite being a defeatist shows his meticulous planning and his responsibility towards its duties. The new Space Earth civilization has to adapt to a new home and change their morality to survive in the spaceship.

> Not being able to save the world isn't your fault, but giving the world hope only to shatter it again is an unforgivable sin

The way Luo Ji gets ridiculed after being called the Messiah for saving the Earth shows us how humans react to hope and how powerful and malleable it is 

The book picks up the pace in the last 1/3 of the book, which I could finish in one sitting. I had to struggle through some portions in the first two sections of the book. <i> The Battle of Darkness </i>  with the droplet's superior surface composition changed the whole expectation from the war

I am not sure what to expect for the final book <i> Death's End </i> as this book ties a lot of loose ends and completes without much curiosity about the next book. Nevertheless, I expect certain things to go wrong which can lead to the Doomsday battle.
