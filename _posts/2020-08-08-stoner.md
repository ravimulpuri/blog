### Review

I read _Stoner_ after I completed the <i>Three-Body Problem </i> series. I had to spend some time to transition from non-linear story to linear story writing.

When I think about Bill's parents, all I can think of are the ways they tried to help Bill to succeed in his life. They tried their best to support Bill with money, college education, marriage, etc. They never imposed any of their necessities on Bill. Bill is also empathetic of his parent's life and difficulties. As Bill aged, he and his parents became strangers and he felt that his love increased by its loss

> “If you think you ought to stay here and study your books, then that’s what you ought to do” - Bill's father on spending additional years at the University for Master of Arts

> “Think you could manage the place all by yourself?” - Bill to his parents while mentioning that he won't be coming back

Bill's marriage is a disaster. And that is one of the biggest mistakes of his life. It's so tough to see him struggle through the marriage without ever being loved until Katherine entered into his life. 

> "He stared up into the dark and wondered at the strangeness that had come over his life, and for the first time questioned the wisdom of what he was about to do" - Bill contemplating on his marriage

While Bill is numb to certain feelings (world wars, patriotism, office politics), he is deeply interested in literature and teaching and thus spends a lot of time in the university. The university becomes his go-to place to avoid struggles at home and social life

During his early 40s, he had a midlife crisis where he questions his past and future. But when Katherine enters his life at 43, he had a turnaround. He leads two separate lives - one with Katherine and one with Edith. Their relationship turns from passion, to lust, and finally to love. But due to the fight with Holly, he had to suffer through his academics and love life

> "that the person one loves at first is not the person one loves at last, and that love is not an end but a process through which one person attempts to know another" - when Katherine left Bill

> "Oh, how proper we seem to ourselves when we have no reason to be improper" Katherine and Bill on being improper

Bill is devoid of any feeling in his life after Katherine leaves him. He doesn't care for Edith's tantrums or for his daughter's college life. 

In the end, this book is neither for one looking for motivation nor for one who is looking for a happy ending. It's a depressing book that is brutally honest about a person who manages to feel all the emotions that life had to offer him and not willing to bend of any one emotion. He took pride and enjoyment in his education, accepted tumultuous life with Edith, suffered while teaching 3-4 courses every semester for almost 40 years, didn't hold back when he aspired for love outside his marriage, didn't fight against the department head until the end, etc. 

> "He had conceived wisdom, and at the end of the long years he had found ignorance" - Bill at the end of his life

### Highlights 

---

* "If you think you ought to stay here and study your books, then that's what you ought to do," his father concludes towards the end of that moving scene.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 110-111</sup></p>

* She was educated upon the premise that she would be protected from the gross events that life might thrust in her way, and upon the premise that she had no other duty than to be a graceful and accomplished accessory to that protection, since she belonged to a social and economic class to which protection was an almost sacred obligation

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 126-128</sup></p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>note @ loc. 128</sup></p>

* Soon after their daughter is born, the child becomes the focus of the mother's inner turmoil, her unresolved hatred of Stoner.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 144-145</sup></p>

* _Note:_
Why did she hate stoner

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>note @ loc. 145</sup></p>

* Pressed towards the end of the interview he complains about the change away from pure study within the universities, the results of which cannot be predicted, towards a purely utilitarian, problem-solving way of doing things more efficiently, both in the arts and sciences, all of which can be predicated and measured.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 174-177</sup></p>

* "Think you could manage the place all by yourself?"

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 241-241</sup></p>

* _Note:_
Its interesting that he is hoping for denial

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>note @ loc. 245</sup></p>

* "You really want me to go?" he asked, as if he half hoped for a denial. "You really want me to?"

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 245-246</sup></p>

* He became conscious of himself in a way that he had not done before.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 390-391</sup></p>

* and he wondered if he appeared as ludicrous to others as he did to himself.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 392-393</sup></p>

* For three hours every afternoon and for half a day on the weekends he allowed himself to be used as Jim and Serena Foote desired; the rest of the time he claimed as his own.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 395-396</sup></p>

* the child they had borne; he felt a mixed pity for them and a distant love.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 419-420</sup></p>

* He thought of his parents, and they were nearly as strange as

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 419-419</sup></p>

* "No, sir," Stoner said, and the decisiveness of his voice surprised him.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 461-462</sup></p>

* "It's love, Mr. Stoner," Sloane said cheerfully. "You are in love. It's as simple as that."

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 480-481</sup></p>

* He felt his inadequacy to the goal he had so recklessly chosen and felt the attraction of the world he had abandoned.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 504-505</sup></p>

* "If you think you ought to stay here and study your books, then that's what you ought to do. Your ma and me can manage."

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 535-537</sup></p>

* He saw it, not as a flux of event and change and potentiality, but as a territory ahead that awaited his exploration.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 548-549</sup></p>

* But he found that he had nothing to say to them; already, he realized, he and his parents were becoming strangers; and he felt his love increased by its loss.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 556-557</sup></p>

* he felt the logic of grammar, and he thought he perceived how it spread out from itself, permeating the language and supporting human thought.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 571-572</sup></p>

* corrosive and unspoiled bitterness of youth.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 655-657</sup></p>

* He resented the disruption which the war forced upon the University; but he could find in himself no very strong feelings of patriotism, and he could not bring himself to hate the Germans.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 674-676</sup></p>

* "I suppose I'm doing it because it doesn't matter whether I do it or not. And it might be amusing to pass through the world once more before I return to the cloistered and slow extinction that awaits us all."

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 697-699</sup></p>

* "The scholar should not be asked to destroy what he has aimed his life to build."

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 717-718</sup></p>

* He had never got in the habit of introspection, and he found the task of searching his motives a difficult and slightly distasteful one; he felt that he had little to offer to himself and that there was little within him which he could find.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 734-736</sup></p>

* Her moral training, both at the schools she attended and at home, was negative in nature, prohibitive in intent, and almost entirely sexual.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 989-989</sup></p>

* Anger was days of courteous silence, and love was a word of courteous endearment.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 994-994</sup></p>

* Like many men who consider their success incomplete, he was extraordinarily vain and consumed with a sense of his own importance.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1055-1056</sup></p>

* He stared up into the dark and wondered at the strangeness that had come over his life, and for the first time questioned the wisdom of what he was about to do.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1213-1213</sup></p>

* William Stoner felt an outrush of affection for the tall, delicate girl who walked beside him, and he felt a quiet passion rise within him, warm and formally sensuous, like the colors that came out from the walls around him.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1218-1220</sup></p>

* Like all country folk, his parents had burial policies, toward which for most of their lives they had set aside a few pennies each week,

* Like all country folk, his parents had burial policies, toward which for most of their lives they had set aside a few pennies each week, even during the times of most desperate need.

* last he realized that she wished only to die, and wished to do so where she had lived; and he knew that she deserved the little dignity she could find in doing as she wanted to do.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1768-1770</sup></p>

* Stoner was moved by a tenderness that he never foresaw.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1829-1830</sup></p>

* He did not speak to Edith about her new behavior; her activities caused him only minor annoyance, and

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1937-1937</sup></p>

* He did not speak to Edith about her new behavior; her activities caused him only minor annoyance, and she seemed happy, though perhaps a bit desperately so.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1937-1938</sup></p>

* He felt at times that he was a kind of vegetable, and he longed for something--even pain--to pierce him, to bring him alive.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3068-3070</sup></p>

* at will, he seemed able to remove his consciousness from the body that contained it, and he observed himself as if he were an oddly familiar stranger doing the oddly familiar things that he had to do. It was a dissociation that he had never felt before; he knew that he ought to be troubled by it, but he was numb, and he could not convince himself that it mattered. He was forty-two years old, and he could see nothing before him that he wished to enjoy and little behind him that he cared to remember.

* Oh, how proper we seem to ourselves when we have no reason to be improper

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3377-3377</sup></p>

* It takes being in love to know something about yourself. Sometimes, with you, I feel like the slut of the world, the eager, faithful slut of the world.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3377-3378</sup></p>

* Only by an effort of the will could he remind himself that he was deceiving Edith. The two parts of his life were as separate as the two parts of a life can be; and though he knew that his powers of introspection were weak and that he was capable of self-deception, he could not make himself believe that he was doing harm to anyone for whom he felt responsibility.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3435-3438</sup></p>

* and though he knew that his powers of introspection were weak and that he was capable of self-deception,

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3813-3815</sup></p>

* Like many others who went through that time, he was gripped by what he could think of only as a numbness, though he knew it was a feeling compounded of emotions so deep and intense that they could not be acknowledged because they could not be lived with.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 4182-4184</sup></p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 4259-4259</sup></p>

* And the sense of his loss, that he had for so long dammed within him, flooded out, engulfed him, and he let himself be carried outward, beyond the control of his will;

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 4275-4276</sup></p>

* He tried to see beyond that time; he could not see, and had no wish to do so.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 4292-4293</sup></p>
