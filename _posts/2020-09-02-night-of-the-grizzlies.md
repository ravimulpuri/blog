My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3528394229">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
In the 60's, around national parks, human's attitude towards bears is more casual as there weren't lot of attacks. So there weren't strict rules around approaching bears, or feeding them. But the two events in August, 1967 at Glacier National Park shifted our behavior towards bears - to be more watchful for their presence, to not feed them, to not run away from them. The events which were transcribed in detail in this book, helped to change the infrastructure around the campgrounds, food storage etc. over the years from mid 60's.<br /><br />While Grizzlies are fascinating creatures they command fear and attention, their attitude towards humans evolved over the years. So while I get excited to watch grizzlies from a safe distance, I will also be careful to carry bear spray with me on trails<br /><br />
