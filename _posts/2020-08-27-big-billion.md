### Review

Fast paced book with good insights into Flipkart uprise. It's easy to say that Flipkart is a clone of Amazon in the West. But the problems they solved, the infrastructure they setup, the innovative or juggad solutions for problems such as faulty payment options laid the path for all the ecommerce companies that were established later including Amazon. <br /><br />This book is not just about how Flipkart's journey over years but also about personalities of people who were deeply invested in it - how the founders Sachin and Binny matured overed the years, Sachin's itch to make Flipkart as a technology company and his crazy implementation of mobile only platform, ego struggle as Flipkart became big, how they lost their edge to Amazon and fought their way back with exclusive partnership with Motorola.
