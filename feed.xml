&lt;p&gt;My rating: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3559140970&quot;&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I read this book way back in 2014, but I couldn’t resist writing a review for this book when I am looking for a Telugu book to read. I was uncomfortable reading this book throughout as the writing is hard-hitting. The book is small, but it took some time to finish it as the depth in writing makes you contemplate as you read each paragraph. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The protagonist, Sitaramao, comes up with excuses to do things and reasons to hate people, situations, and community. His opinions are so strong that he and the community around him find it tough to intertwine. In the end, the author leaves us to understand and judge his character
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
