The best fiction book that I have read so far. When I started reading this book, I was unsure whether I could invest time in reading all the books in series (10 in total) as the first book alone has 1137 pages. But it was totally worth the read. The book established the characters, society, themes and concepts in the Cosmere world really well. While reading the last quarter of the book, I couldn’t put it down without reading it for at least three hours straight in a sitting. By the time I finished reading this book, I had got so astonished by the twists and turns and took few hours just to absorb what I had just read I am excited to start the second book in this series, Words of radiance :) View all my reviews .",

            "content": ". My rating: 4 of 5 stars I have not watched any match that Sanjay played for India, but I watched many matches in which he was a commentator. I liked his commentary, and as he came across as someone who is not afraid to call a spade as a spade. Coming to this book, I liked the first few chapters, where Sanjay explained how his childhood shaped his career choice as a cricketer and his batting style (defensive). Sanjay played cricket for fame and is forthcoming about it. It is interesting to read about Mumbai cricket scene, Ranji tournaments, and North vs West zone rivalry. Sadly, Sanjay played cricket when India is not competitive in away matches, not aggressive in their approach towards the game, and not supportive to fellow cricketers. Since I did not watch any of his matches, I could not connect too much of Sanjay’s cricketing life. However, in the last chapter, Sanjay goes into the details about his life as a commentator. Sanjay chose to be a commentator to be visible in the public eye and not fade out like other cricketers in his generation. As a commentator, Sanjay can get extremely critical because of his analytical mindset. However, many cricketers/viewers took it personally instead of seeing it as a person doing his job. I am glad Sanjay is not backing down from being critical as some of the commentators do not trust the intelligence of the viewers. It is a welcoming book if you are interested in the game. Former cricketers, in their autobiographies, tend to glorify their struggle or game or write about controversies to sell but this book isn’t View all my reviews .",

            "content": ". My rating: 5 of 5 stars I didn’t know much about Nike’s history until I read this book by Phil Knight.I loved Phil’s travel stories from around the world. Traveling around the world at such an early age helped Phil understand the intricacies of different cultures, enabling him to navigate supply chain constraints later. Phil didn’t start Blue Ribbon to create the best shoe company. The whole idea of starting a company is an afterthought after receiving a contract to sell shoes in the US. Gradually, the business turned into an obsession, which led to create and sell a new line of shoes. It’s amusing to read Phil’s struggle to keep Blue Ribbon afloat, flaunt bank rules, steal an official’s notes. Amusing as it’s so well written without adding the heaviness of creating a billion-dollar company or being preachy with some entrepreneurship BS. View all my reviews .",

I was uncomfortable reading this book throughout as the writing is hard-hitting. The book is small, but it took some time to finish it as the depth in writing makes you contemplate as you read each paragraph. The protagonist, Sitaramao, comes up with excuses to do things and reasons to hate people, situations, and community. His opinions are so strong that he and the community around him find it tough to intertwine. In the end, the author leaves us to understand and judge his character . View all my reviews .",

            "content": ". My rating: 5 of 5 stars In the 60’s, around national parks, human’s attitude towards bears is more casual as there weren’t lot of attacks. So there weren’t strict rules around approaching bears, or feeding them. But the two events in August, 1967 at Glacier National Park shifted our behavior towards bears - to be more watchful for their presence, to not feed them, to not run away from them. The events which were transcribed in detail in this book, helped to change the infrastructure around the campgrounds, food storage etc. over the years from mid 60’s.While Grizzlies are fascinating creatures they command fear and attention, their attitude towards humans evolved over the years. So while I get excited to watch grizzlies from a safe distance, I will also be careful to carry bear spray with me on trails View all my reviews .",
