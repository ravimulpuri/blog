            "content": "The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson My rating: 5 of 5 stars . Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination. I will protect those who cannot protect themselves Masterpiece !!! The best fiction book that I have read so far. When I started reading this book, I was unsure whether I could invest time in reading all the books in series (10 in total) as the first book alone has 1137 pages. But it was really worth the read. The book established the characters, society, themes and concepts in the Cosmere world. In the last quarter of the book, I couldn’t put down this book without reading it straight for three hours in a day. By the time I finished reading this book, I had got so astonished by the twists and turns and took few hours to just absorb what I had just readI am excited to start the second book in this series, Words of radiance :) View all my reviews .",

            "content": ". My rating: 5 of 5 stars I read this book way back in 2014, but I couldn’t resist writing a review for this book when I am looking for a Telugu book to read. I was uncomfortable reading this book throughout as the writing is hard-hitting. The book is small, but it took some time to finish it as the depth in writing makes you contemplate as you read each paragraph. The protagonist, Sitaramao, comes up with excuses to do things and reasons to hate people, situations, and community. His opinions are so strong that he and the community around him find it tough to intertwine. In the end, the author leaves us to understand and judge his character . View all my reviews .",
