            "content": "Introduction . The goal of this machine learning challenge is to check if I can build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict the points for a given wine review based on attributes such as price, region_1, variety, windery etc.This is a proof-of-concept for a full-production solution that will be deployed at the client. In this report, I will detail the steps that I have taken and the approaches that I have followed to understand, validate, analyze and build machine learning model . In the wine rating, points measure the quality of wine which for the sample data varies from 80 to 100. The remaining 12 coloumns are country, description, designation, price, province, region_1, region_2, taster_name, taster_twitter_handle, title, variety and winery. In the exploratory data analysis (EDA) section, I will mention more details about each variables . The report is organized as follows . I will cover the exploratory analysis of each column in the data and mention what are the best way to handle each tag in terms of imputation, scaling/encoding, feature engineering etc | In the second section, I will introduce the tasks created for this end-to-end project and mention what goes on with in each task | In the third section, I will discuss about the model results and it&#39;s relevancy. If the model is relevant, I will also discuss about the model&#39;s important features | In the last section, I will discuss about the flexibility in deploying this model because of the retrain option | . Exploratory data analysis . Imports . Let&#39;s load all the import needed for the dataset at the beginning . #collapse import dython import spacy import squarify import pandas as pd import numpy as np import missingno as msno import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns from sklearn import preprocessing from wordcloud import WordCloud from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler from sklearn import decomposition from IPython.core.interactiveshell import InteractiveShell InteractiveShell.ast_node_interactivity = &quot;all&quot; nlp = spacy.load(&quot;en_core_web_sm&quot;, disable=[&#39;tagger&#39;, &#39;parser&#39;, &#39;ner&#39;]) spacy_stopwords = spacy.lang.en.stop_words.STOP_WORDS # set this to avoid correlation computations fast = False . . Load data . The dataset is available as wine_dataset.csv. Let&#39;s load the dataset as a pandas dataframe to access it&#39;s wide range of convenient options. It was mentioned in the challenge to consider dask, so that pipeline can run on large datasets, But pandas is preferred to acccess it&#39;s wide range of functions and utilities for data analysis with in the limited time. Transposed view of the dataframe can be viewed below . #collapse df = pd.read_csv(&#39;/usr/share/data/raw/wine_dataset.csv&#39;) df.head(n=3).T . . 0 1 2 .

Missing fraction . Let&#39;s look at the amount of data missing per column. The grey color shows the fraction of data available and white color shows the fraction of data missing . #collapse msno.bar(df); . . Let&#39;s look at region_2 since it has more than 50% of missing data. Even though region_2 has more than 50% of missing data, it provides some supplemental information to the wine along with region_1, region_2 is not discarded from the analysis . df[&#39;region_2&#39;].value_counts(dropna=False, normalize=True) .

Correlation . Let&#39;s compute correlation for the entire dataset. dython identifies the type of variable and tries to compute correlation in a reasonable way . #collapse from dython.nominal import associations if not fast: corr = associations(df.sample(frac=0.5).copy(), figsize=(15, 15)) . . The heatmap shows the following things . taster_name and taster_twitter_handle have strong correlation 1.0. So taster_twitter_handle can be removed | price and points are NOT following any association in it&#39;s original form | Association between a categorical column with high cardinality and other variable is high. The association is measured using Thiels U score is biased towards high cardinal categorical features | Duplicate rows . A row is considered as duplicate if it has the same description, title and taster_name with other rows. Some of the duplicate rows are mentioned below along with their index. Transposed view of the dataframe can be viewed below . #collapse duplicates = df[df.duplicated(subset=[&#39;description&#39;,&#39;title&#39;, &#39;taster_name&#39;], keep=False)] print(f&#39;Number of duplicate rows is {duplicates.shape[0]/2}&#39;) duplicates.sort_values([&#39;description&#39;, &#39;title&#39;, &#39;taster_name&#39;]).head(3).T . .

Since duplicate rows doesn&#39;t add any additional information, they will be dropped . #collapse df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=[&#39;description&#39;, &#39;title&#39;, &#39;taster_name&#39;], keep=&#39;first&#39;) . . Columns . Let&#39;s look at each column one-by-one and check for it&#39;s missingness, uniqueness, and decide on how to impute, transform and encode each column for the final model . Unnamed: 0 . &#39;Unnamed: 0&#39; indexes the rows of the dataset. So the column can be removed from the dataset as it doesn&#39;t add any information . #collapse df[[&#39;Unnamed: 0&#39;]].plot(); numerical_cols = [c for c in numerical_cols if c != &#39;Unnamed: 0&#39;] df.drop(labels=[&#39;Unnamed: 0&#39;], axis=&#39;columns&#39;, inplace=True) f&quot;Numerical columns after removing &#39;Unnamed: 0&#39; are {numerical_cols}&quot; . . &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fa62d33a160&gt; . &#34;Numerical columns after removing &#39;Unnamed: 0&#39; are [&#39;points&#39;, &#39;price&#39;]&#34; . taster_twitter_handle . taster_twitter_handle has high correlation, close to 1 with taster_name. So taster_twitter_handle will be dropped . #collapse categorical_cols = [c for c in categorical_cols if c != &#39;taster_twitter_handle&#39;] df.drop(labels=[&#39;taster_twitter_handle&#39;], axis=&#39;columns&#39;, inplace=True) f&quot;Categorical columns after removing &#39;taster_twitter_handle&#39; are n{categorical_cols}&quot; . . &#34;Categorical columns after removing &#39;taster_twitter_handle&#39; are n[&#39;country&#39;, &#39;description&#39;, &#39;designation&#39;, &#39;province&#39;, &#39;region_1&#39;, &#39;region_2&#39;, &#39;taster_name&#39;, &#39;title&#39;, &#39;variety&#39;, &#39;winery&#39;]&#34; . price . price represents the cost of the wine under review . info . 75% of the wines reviewed costs less than $42. The distribution is heavily skewed. So scaling must be done properly to ensure that low priced wines price are properly represented in the dataset . #collapse df[&#39;price&#39;].describe() df[&#39;price&#39;].hist(legend=True); . . vs points . The relationship between price and points can help in easily identifying any relationship between them . #collapse df[[&#39;price&#39;, &#39;points&#39;]].plot.scatter(x=&#39;price&#39;, y=&#39;points&#39;) plt.show(); . . scaling . Due to it&#39;s skewness, log scaling can help in reducing the skewness. The scaled and transformed makes it easy to understand the relation between points and log transformed price. The correlation increased by ~0.1 from its raw representation . #collapse df[&#39;price&#39;] = df[&#39;price&#39;].transform(lambda x: np.log(x + 0.1)) _ = plt.hist(df[&#39;price&#39;]) _ =df[[&#39;price&#39;, &#39;points&#39;]].plot.scatter(x=&#39;price&#39;, y=&#39;points&#39;) df[[&#39;price&#39;, &#39;points&#39;]].corr() . . price points . price 1.000000 | 0.608184 | . points 0.608184 | 1.000000 | . imputation . We can use median of log transformed value to impute the missing values as the log-distribution is close to gaussian distribution. price has 6.7% of missing values and they will be replaced with median value of the column . #collapse print(&#39;Missing data for price column before imputation&#39;) df[&#39;price&#39;].value_counts(dropna=False, normalize=True)*100 df[&#39;price&#39;] = df[&#39;price&#39;].fillna(value=df[&#39;price&#39;].median()) print(&#39; nNo missing data for price column after imputation&#39;) df[&#39;price&#39;].value_counts(dropna=False, normalize=True)*100 . .

Number of country 37 . Imputation . Imputing values for tree-based models is unnecessary as they can handle it themselves. But if non tree based models are used, we can either use US or a new unknown-country to impute the missing data. One other way of imputing the data is to use the available categories(37) and create a distribution with category probability associated with normalized value counts . df[column] = df[column].fillna(value=f&#39;unknown-{column}&#39;) . encoding . #collapse ohe = preprocessing.OneHotEncoder(sparse=False) ohe.fit_transform(df[[column]]) . . array([[0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.], ..., [0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 1., ..., 0., 0., 0.]]) . Since the number of available categories is less than 50, we may not have to worry about the cardinality for country variable . description . There are as many descriptions as the number of reviews. It looks like, each review is unique (It should be since we removed the duplicates). This variable should be treated as a text variable. . #collapse column = &#39;description&#39; df[column].describe() . . count 9942 unique 9942 top A tannic, structured wine, full of rich stone ... freq 1 Name: description, dtype: object . There are several ways to take advantage of the description of review. One hypothesis is frequent usage of praise words can be seen as a positive review and hence more points. Let&#39;s do TF-IDF of description and see which words appear more in the high score reviews vs low score reviews. We can also do a word cloud representation of the descriptions to see what words appeared more in the description . word cloud . #collapse plt.figure(figsize= (24, 16)) plt.title(f&#39;Word cloud of {column}&#39;) wc = WordCloud(max_words=1000, max_font_size=40,background_color=&#39;black&#39;, stopwords = spacy_stopwords,colormap=&#39;Set1&#39;) wc.generate(&#39; &#39;.join(df[column])) plt.imshow(wc,interpolation=&quot;bilinear&quot;) plt.axis(&#39;off&#39;); . . All the words appeared to be in English language. So we make assumption all the descriptions are English only. This assumption is important in word tokenization . Imputation . Imputing values for tree-based models is unnecessary as they can handle it themselves. But if non tree based models are used, we can use a new unknown-description to impute the missing data . #collapse df[column] = df[column].fillna(value=f&#39;unknown-{column}&#39;) . . encoding . For high cardinal features, we can use truncated svd to reduce the dimensionality of Tf-Idf matrix . #collapse def select_n_components(var_ratio, goal_var: float) -&gt; int: # Set initial variance explained so far total_variance = 0.0 # Set initial number of features n_components = 0 # For the explained variance of each feature: for explained_variance in var_ratio: # Add the explained variance to the total total_variance += explained_variance # Add one to the number of components n_components += 1 # If we reach our goal level of explained variance if total_variance &gt;= goal_var: # End the loop break # Return the number of components return n_components . .

(&lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fa629345820&gt;,) . Machine learning Pipeline . For this project, I followed the pipeline shown below. In this section, I will give a brief overview of what each block does and how fits into the Machine learning pipeline . . Download data . This task downloads csv file and save its to a disl . Validate data . This task compares and validate the data against expectations (~10 so far) that are derived from the data model is trained on. The expectations are based on general understanding of the sample data that was provided. The expectations are created by observing the uniqueness, distribution and several other characteristics of each column. Preview of the validation webpage is shown here. To know more details, check out ./data_root/processed/great_expectations/unprocessed/data_docs/local_site/index.html from the project root folder . . Visualize data . Visualize the dataset using dataprep. The html file generated(./data_root/processed/visualize_dataset.html) will show plots, histograms, correlations, unique value counts, and lot more information to look at. This can be helpful to understand the data and how it has impacted the model during debugging . . Clean data . This task is to clean the dataset using the following steps . Drop columns - columns that are not important for the model | Drop rows - duplicate rows based on title, description and taster_name will be dropped | . Make dataset . This task splits the dataset based on the points distribution. It does so my considering the points column as categorical and does stratified sampling based on the category (value) of points. After the split, the points column is converted back into float format. . This task also adds a row with unknown-{col_name} value to take care of any categorical encoding that can happen later. Since there is a possiblity for encoding the categorical variables downstream, adding this columns helps in establishing unknown-{col_name} for each categorical column. So for any categorical column with a category that is NOT available during training, the value will be mapped to unknown-{col_name} and the dataset will be transformed without any errors. This approach also has the benefit of not amplifying most commonly occurring category . Impute data . This task imputes the dataset for any missing values. categorical columns are imputed with unknown-{col_name} and numerical columns are imputed using the median of the column. To get more details look at the columns section of this post . Feature engineering . This task creates new features from existing features in the dataset without replacing them (difference between feature engineering task and encoding task) . Encode data . This task encodes columns as per the following manner. For more details, look in to the exploratory data analysis section of this post . country - OneHotEncoder - 37 unique values | region_2 - OneHotEncoder - 17 unique values | taster_name - OneHotEncoder - 18 unique values | variety - OneHotEncoder + truncatedsvd(25) - 333 unique values | province - OneHotEncoder + truncatedsvd(25) - 248 unique values | region_1 - OneHotEncoder + truncatedsvd(25) - 724 unique values | description - tokenize + truncatedsvd(75) - 9942 tf-idf values | title - tokenize + truncatedsvd(75) - 11027 unique values | price - log transform | grapes_used - No transformation needed | points - No transformation needed | Base model . This task creates base model on the dataset created after the make_dataset task. The strategy is to use median value as the prediction for the output variable. This model can serve as a starting base line score . Final model . This task develops a model that is based on the best hand-picked hyper-parameters for the dataset . The model is formulated as a supervised regression problem that is built on the sample data provided and has the capability to predict on the new data as well as retrain from scratch on the new data. Predictions will be based on the model that is created using the encoded dataset. . Metric . An evaluation metric measure the performance of any machine learning model. Evaluation metric depends on the problem at hand. A good evaluation metric can help the user understand the model without having an extensive inside knowledge about the model. A bad evaluation metric can make it help to map the improvement in the evaluation metric to business use case . Mean Square error is used as evaluation metric. It measures the error between true value and predicted value and averages the error over all the observations. MSE is more interpretable than other measures of regression like R2 etc. because it is easily interpretable for this problem and familiar to lot of people. . Model details . Random forest regressor is used as the final model as it has some properties that are important to the current problem . since the dataset size is small, we do not want the model to overfit. Random forest, because of bagging, multiple trees, randomness in creating trees makes it a good candidate for constructing the regressor | Random Forest method of building the model and understanding the data makes it easy to understand the model at a high level very easily | Random Forest can also provide feature importance values based on the where and how a feature is used in the constructing the trees. However, care should be taken as Random forest importance can tend to biased in certain cases | . Evaluate model . Evaluate base model and final model performance on the test data and compare them to identify and improvements and generate a report . The evaluation report is available in the as evaluate_model.html . For evaluation data that is not used as a part of training is to used to evaluate the model so as to avoid any data leakage in to the model. MSE is computed for both the final model and base model on the test data. For the current model, I see a significant decrease in the MSE from 9 to 4.6 showing ~50% improvement over the base model. Moreover, it serves as a proof that the final model is a good predictor of wine points. Since the model can also predict on large datasets without training the entire pipeline from scratch, we can quickly check how the model performs on new data before making a decision on whether to retrain the model from scratch or not . If we look at the true and prediction distribution of the test data, we can notice that the model predictions are more close to the median of the data and less predictions towards the tail. This observations also confirms with the choice of metric which is designed to reduce the error . . . Feature Importance . This task finds out the best features that can explain the model predictions. Any estimator can be used as a final model and as long as it follows the scikit-learn API, it will be easy to generate feature importance plots. Feature importances can help in identifying what feature drive the prediction. For more details about the pipeline, check out the feature importance task section. . The feature importance values are based on the in-built values random forest estimator. Even though the permutation based feature importance is less biased and more robust, it is not used as the task can take a long time to complete. This challenge mentioned that tasks should be executed as quickly as possible. So deep neural networks or other fancy methods are not used either in several tasks . price seems to be a good indicator for model and its feature importance is much higher than any other feature used for modeling. So in the plot below, I have excluded price and used other columns to plot the following based on sorted feature importance scores . . The other factors that influence the predictions are the reviewers, countries (few countries strongly influence predictions). These are in line with some the observations noticed during exploratory data analysis which confirms that the model is behaving well . Flexibility . The machine learning pipeline constructed has the flexibility to get predictions on the big data without training the entire pipeline once again. If the performance measure is good enough and the sample dataset captures all the data characteristics of the full dataset, lot of time can be saved by training on the small data and predicting on all the data. This leads to pipeline quantization effort in developing and deploying the model . To run the pipeline from scratch . Go to project root folder# remove all the contents from data root folder sudo rm -rf ./data_root/* . | . Run the pipeline to save estimators and generate all the intermediate and final files docker-compose up orchestrator . | . To use the exisiting pipeline . Go to project root folder | . # remove all the files except estimators from previous run sudo rm -rf ./data_root/raw/wine_dataset.csv ./data_root/SUCCESS.* ./data_root/processed/*html ./data_root/interim/*.parquet ./data_root/processed/*.parquet ./data_root/processed/*.png . Optional step - add new data URL (preferable) or add new wine_dataset.csv in the ./data_root/wine_dataset.csv . | set RETRAIN environment variable to &quot;false&quot; in orchestrator/task.py. Do it manually . | run the pipeline and check the progress on Luigi . docker-compose up orchestrator . | . Luigi . luigi is used to keep track of tasks and dependencies. The machine learning pipeline mentioned above is converted to a luigi pipeline displayed below . . Improvements . During the course of this project, I made several choices to balance among speed, evaluation metric and complexity. I mention some of the things that can addressed to improve the performance of the model . There are few localized feature importance techniques like SHAP and LIME which are not explored but can help in identifying the factors that influence a prediction at observation level | Permutation based feature importance methods are not considered due to its time complexity. But they provided better unbiased estimates than the default random forest feature importance estimates | Boosting methods are not actively considered in the interest of time and boosting methods didn&#39;t play nicely in my overall approach of exploration vs exploitation strategy used during this project | Docker container size can be reduced by building the image from base python. Instead, I started with jupyter base image that is available on hub and used wherever I can. To generated visualizations and validations, I had to use different docker images as the jupyter docker image is not working after installing some packages required for visualization and validation | .",

I was uncomfortable reading this book throughout as the writing is hard-hitting. The book is small, but it took some time to finish it as the depth in writing makes you contemplate as you read each paragraph. The protagonist, Sitaramao, comes up with excuses to do things and reasons to hate people, situations, and community. His opinions are so strong that he and the community around him find it tough to intertwine. In the end, the author leaves us to understand and judge his character . View all my reviews .",
